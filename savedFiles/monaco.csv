"The Genoese built a fortress on the site of present-day Monaco in 1215. The current ruling GRIMALDI family first seized control in 1297 but was not able to permanently secure its holding until 1419. Economic development was spurred in the late 19th century with a railroad linkup to France and the opening of a casino. Since then, the principality's mild climate, coastal Mediterranean scenery, and gambling facilities have made Monaco world famous as a tourist and recreation center.","Western Europe, bordering the Mediterranean Sea on the southern coast of France, near the border with Italy","43 44 N, 7 24 E",Europe,total:;2 sq km;land:;2 sq km;water:;0 sq km,"about three times the size of the National Mall in Washington, DC",total:;6 km;border countries (1):;France 6 km,4.1 km,territorial sea:;12 nm;exclusive economic zone:;12 nm,"Mediterranean with mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers","hilly, rugged, rocky",highest point:;Chemin des Revoires on Mont Agel 162 m;lowest point:;Mediterranean Sea 0 m,none,agricultural land:;1% (2018 est.);arable land: 0% (2018 est.);permanent crops: 1% (2018 est.);permanent pasture: 0% (2018 est.);forest:;0% (2018 est.);other:;99% (2018 est.),0 sq km (2022),the second most densely populated country in the world (after Macau); its entire population living on 2 square km,none,second-smallest independent state in the world (after the Holy See); smallest country with a coastline; almost entirely urban,"31,597 (2023 est.);note:;immigrants make up almost 68% of the total population, according to UN data (2019)",noun:;Monegasque(s) or Monacan(s);adjective:;Monegasque or Monacan,"Monegasque 32.1%, French 19.9%, Italian 15.3%, British 5%, Belgian 2.3%, Swiss 2%, German 1.9%, Russian 1.8%, American 1.1%, Dutch 1.1%, Moroccan 1%, other 16.6% (2016 est.);note:;data represent population by country of birth","French (official), English, Italian, Monegasque;major-language sample(s):;The World Factbook, une source indispensable d'informations de base.
